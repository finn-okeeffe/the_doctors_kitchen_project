[The Doctor's Kitchen](https://thedoctorskitchen.com/) is a recipe website created by Dr. Rupy Aujla. The site aims to provide recipes which have evidence-based health benefits. As a fun side project, I thought I would scrape and analyse the recipes on this website. The goals for this project are:
- Find the most and least used ingredients
- Find what cooking equipment each recipe uses, this isn't listed nicely in each recipe.
- Be able to search and filter recipes by ingredient, equipment, time to cook, and more.

If anyone wants to use this practically, The Doctor's Kitchen has an official app that you should use instead.

This project is not endorsed by The Doctor's Kitchen.
