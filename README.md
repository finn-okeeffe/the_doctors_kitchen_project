[The Doctor's Kitchen](https://thedoctorskitchen.com/) is a recipe website created by Dr. Rupy Aujla. The site aims to provide recipes which have evidence-based health benefits. As a fun side project, I thought I would scrape and analyse the recipes on this website. The goals for this project are:
- Find the most and least used ingredients
- Find what cooking equipment each recipe uses, this isn't listed nicely in each recipe.
- Be able to search and filter recipes by ingredient, equipment, time to cook, and more.

The folder [scraper](scraper/) contains the code used to scrape and process recipe data from the website.

The folder [streamlit_app](streamlit_app/) contains streamlist app code. Soon this app will be published online.

This project is not endorsed by The Doctor's Kitchen.
